The book is written in Indonesian language and has 267 pages. The book is divided into 12 chapters, each with a summary and a list of references.
 
The book is one of the few books on mechanical drawing that follows the ISO standards in Indonesia. It is also one of the works of G. Takeshi Sato, a Japanese engineer who has contributed to the development of mechanical engineering education in Indonesia. He has written several books and papers on mechanical engineering topics, such as machine design, manufacturing processes, and quality control.
 
The book is a useful reference for anyone who wants to learn or improve their skills in mechanical drawing. It provides clear explanations and illustrations of the concepts and rules of drawing machines according to ISO standards. It also offers practical exercises and problems that can help readers apply their knowledge and test their understanding.
  
One of the advantages of using ISO standards for mechanical drawing is that they facilitate the communication and exchange of information among engineers, designers, manufacturers, and customers from different countries and regions. ISO standards also ensure the consistency and accuracy of the drawings and reduce the possibility of errors and misunderstandings. Moreover, ISO standards help to improve the quality and performance of the machines and products that are drawn according to them.
